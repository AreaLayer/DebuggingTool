OmniBOLT Daemon Debugging Tool. This is a graphic user interface for developers. Every API on the left navigation tree has been defined in [api.omnilab.online](https://api.omnilab.online). This tool is in fact a lightning wallet.  

If you come to this tool in developing modules for OmniBOLT, you must have successfully installed and ran OBD on your local or remote machine. If you do not familiar with the whole process yet, we suggest you [install](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/obd#table-of-contents) OBD first and try to run it for a quick experience.  

In this tutorial, you can connect either your own OBD node, or the [nodes in the testnet](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/DebuggingTool#Nodes-in-testnet) we configured for our community.
